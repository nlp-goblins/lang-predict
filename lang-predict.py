# ## TODO
#
# - [ ] Acquisition
#     - [ ] Select what list of repos to scrape.
#     - [ ] Get requests form the site.
#     - [ ] Save responses to csv.
# - [ ] Preparation
#     - [ ] Prepare the data for analysis.
# - [ ] Exploration
#     - [ ] Answer the following prompts:
#         - [ ] What are the most common words in READMEs?
#         - [ ] What does the distribution of IDFs look like for the most common words?
#         - [ ] Does the length of the README vary by language?
#         - [ ] Do different languages use a different number of unique words?
# - [ ] Modeling
#     - [ ] Transform the data for machine learning; use language to predict.
#     - [ ] Fit several models using different text repressentations.
#     - [ ] Build a function that will take in the text of a README file, and makes a prediction of language.
# - [ ] Delivery
#     - [ ] Github repo
#         - [x] This notebook.
#         - [ ] Documentation within the notebook.
#         - [ ] README file in the repo.
#         - [ ] Python scripts if applicable.
#     - [ ] Google Slides
