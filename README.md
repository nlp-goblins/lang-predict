# README Prophesy
By Nicole Garza & Michael P. Moran

This goal of this project was to create a model that could predict
the predominant programming language of a repository based solely on its
README file.

The Jupyter notebook contains our code and analysis. The predictor.py (which
depends on lang_predict.py) file contains a function that will predict
the programming language of a repository based on the README text as input.
